# Weather-App
In this project I have made a Weather App for Website using HTML CSS and JavaScript. Used the current weather from
the Fess API key from OpenWeatherMap and displayed the weather information like Temperature,  Weather condition, 
Humidity and Wind Speed according to the city on this website or app.
# Key feature - 
It display the weather info on website from Free API using JavaScript.
In this weather app user can enter any city name and can get the weather information of that particular city.
